# UK Arms Export Data Analysis 
 Source: https://github.com/caatdata/uk-arms-export-data
 Looked at the items.csv file, which shows items approved, revoked or refused for export to specific countries

Interesting findings:
1. The UK exports the most arms to the USA, mainly sports guns
2. The UK sends military aircraft and related equipment to China and various security equipments to India, its second and third most frequent arms importers
3. The UK exports viruses (as well as bacteria and toxins)
4. The UK's main partners for nuclear-related exports are the US and France.

Some next steps:
1. I would like to further investigate what exporting "viruses"/"toxins" means
2. I think it would be interesting, and potentially reveal some stories, to do some visualizations that show how the types of items exported to different countries has changed over time
3. I think it would be cool to make a visualization that shows relative size of flows to different countries and what sorts of things make up the bulk of exports.
